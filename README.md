# Dog-Years
## Codecademy JavaScript Project

### Aim:
To build a programme to calculate human years in dog years.

### Project Brief:
‘Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?
Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:
*	The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
*	Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
With your knowledge of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to convert your human age into dog years.’

### How it Works:
The calculator takes the user’s name (which is converted to lowercase) and age which is calculated in dog years using the rules above.
